                    <p>
                        This project was motivated by the the Hacker News
                        discussion "<a
                            href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=37534615"
                            target="_blank"

                            fragments</a
                        >" and the desire to create a more self contained and
                        practical implementation of the same concept for
                        personal use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The goal was for this tool to work on any platform and
                        require no dependencies (other than a web browser), and
                        be future-proof enough to be usable decades from now. An
                        excellent similar tool was created by Ian Coleman (<a
                            href="https://iancoleman.io/shamir/"

                        >) which heavily inspired this project, this iteration
                        adds more features such as self-contained parts and
                        optional password protection.

                            members. No one can access your accounts alone, but
                            they can recover access together if you are
                            incapacitated.

                            to ensure a single fire or burglary doesn't lock you

                            ensures that no single person holds the power of
                            access.

                    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                </div>

                <details class="menu">
                    <summary>What happens if I lose one of the parts?</summary>
                    <p>
                        As long as you still have the minimum number of parts
                        (your threshold <em>k</em>), you can fully recover your
                        secret. If you fall below that number, the secret is
                        mathematically impossible to recover.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="menu">
                    <summary>Are individual parts "encrypted"?</summary>
                    <p>
                        No, and they don't need to. The individual parts are
                        secure by design because they are mathematically
                        incomplete.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Unless someone possesses the minimum number of parts you
                        specified (the threshold), the individual shares they
                        hold are effectively random noise. They contain zero
                        information about your original secret, making it
                        impossible to "crack" or guess. You can store these
                        files on a USB drive, in the cloud, or on paper without
                        needing any additional encryption or passwords.

                    <summary>
                        Can I use any browsers for splitting and combining?
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        Yes. The self-contained HTML files use standard
                        JavaScript. You can generate them in Chrome on a Mac and
                        reconstruct them in Firefox on Linux. No internet
                        connection is required.

                <details class="menu">
                    <summary>
                        Why is there the option to password-protect the secret
                        when encryption is not needed?
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        This option allows to add a second layer of security if
                        needed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The individual parts cannot be deciphered whether a
                        password is used or not. However, as soon as the minimum
                        number of parts is gathered, the secret can be
                        reconstructed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        By adding a password, even if an attacker manages to
                        collect enough parts, they would still need to know the
                        password to access the original secret.
                    </p>
                </details>

                <details class="menu">
                    <summary>
                        Is there a limit to how large the secret can be?
                    </summary>
                    <p>
                        While there is no hard mathematical limit, extremely
                        large secrets will result in very large HTML files and
                        may slow down your browser's RAM during the splitting
                        process. It is ideal for text up to 50KB (approx. 10,000
                        words).
